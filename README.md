# Tracking_with_MLflow
Customer Churn Prediction Tracking with MLflow


This project implements churn prediction using 7 different machine learning models. For each model, we will track various parameters, metrics, and artifacts following MLOps best practices. The project involves:

## Features

1. **Experiment Tracking with MLflow**: 
   - Track experiments, parameters, metrics, and model performance.

2. **Model Metadata Storage in PostgreSQL**: 
   - Store model metadata, including hyperparameters and training details, in a PostgreSQL database.

3. **Artifact Storage in AWS S3**: 
   - Store model artifacts (e.g., trained models, datasets) in AWS S3 for scalability and accessibility.

4. **Containerized Deployment using Docker**: 
   - Containerize the model deployment environment using Docker for portability and consistency.

5. **Comparison of Multiple Models' Performance**: 
   - Evaluate and compare the performance of 7 different machine learning models to select the best one for churn prediction.
